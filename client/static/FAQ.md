## What is this?

This is a polkadot-testnet faucet. You can use this to load testnet tokens into your account.

## What is a faucet?

A faucet is a developer tool to get a small amount of testnet tokens (ROC) in order to test and troubleshoot a decentralized application or protocol before going live on Polkadot, where one must use real DOT.

Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet. The Polkadot faucet is free, fast, and does not require authentication.

## How do I use this?

To request funds, simply enter your Rococo wallet address, fill the captcha, and hit "Submit".

## How much ROC will I receive?

You will receive 100 ROC per request.

## How often can I request tokens?

You can request tokens every 24h! If you request ROC for one account, you can't request more for another parachain in that period.

## Can I request tokens for a specific parachain?

Yes, you can! To do so, click on "Use Parachain" and then add the ID of your parachain. You can also load the site with the parachain selected by adding the GET parameter to the site "?parachain=1001".

If you want to learn more about Parachains, check out [the docs](https://polkadot.network/features/parachains)!

## What is a testnet token?

Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Polkadot application before going live. Testnet tokens can be used in place of real tokens on testnets like Rococo. You can read more[ here](https://polkadot.network/blog/rococo-v1-a-holiday-gift-to-the-polkadot-community/).

## Can I get real DOTs?

No, we will provide you with TEST DOTs, so you can do your testing and move it to any parachain whenever you are ready
