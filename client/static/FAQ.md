## What is this?

This is a Frequency Rococo faucet based on Polkadot's testnet faucet. You can use this to load testnet tokens into your account.

## What is a faucet?

A faucet is a developer tool to get a small amount of testnet tokens (XRQCY) in order to test and troubleshoot a decentralized application or protocol before going live on Frequency, where one must use real FRQCY.

Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet. The Frequency faucet is free, fast, and does not require authentication.

## How do I use this?

To request funds, simply enter your Frequency Rococo wallet address, fill the captcha, and hit "Submit".

## How much XRQCY will I receive?

You will receive 5000 XRQCY per request.

## How often can I request tokens?

You can request tokens every 24h! If you request XRQCY for one account, you can't request more for that address.

## What is a testnet token?

Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Frequency application before going live. Testnet tokens can be used in place of real tokens on testnets like Rococo.
